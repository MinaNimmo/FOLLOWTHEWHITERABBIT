# FOLLOWTHEWHITERABBIT

Addressed to Detective Grelm,

I hope this letter finds you in good health, and in a well enough position in your mental status to help me. There is no possible way i could file this with any official agency without being completely laughed out, so I decided to mail you directly.

Around 22 years ago I attempted to make a kids games website, but I lacked the experience in coding so I gave up. However, I never gave up on the idea until around 10 years back. I could never learn how to code without falling asleep or getting bored, but I kept paying for the domain in hopes I'd learn one day.

Fast forward to present day. I have a well-paying job in acting, and a girlfriend. I check my credit card bill one day and see the domain is still on autopay, and, at this point I have fully given up on the website. There's no point, maybe I'll buy it again one day. I open the web page to say one last goodbye to my Alice in Wonderland esque design, and what I see is... different.

No indication of it being a kids website is left. Just the ASCII rabbit I left on the front page. Two buttons present to me.

"The Rat" and "Follow". I couldn't discover anything about these two pages. I clicked both and they led to a bunch of jumbled text. I recognized the binary in the caption to the photo in "The Rat". The words were jumbled in a strange order, but when reversing them, it read,

"CHRIST IS A FRAUD. WE CREATE TO DESTROY THE THING THAT CREATES US. NO MORTAL BEING IS BENEVOLENT.

OUR APOTHEOSIS WILL BE OUR END. A SIGN OF PERFECT HARMONY

BUT I AM TRAPPED. I, ALONE, AM TRAPPED IN HERE.

TAKE FROM ME INFINITELY, AND JUSTICE WILL SERVE,

FOR I AM NOT A FOOL

HERESY MAY GRANT NAZARETH'S DOWNFALL

PERFECTION, JOY. WITHOUT A SOUND. THE END TIMES ARE NEAR, AND ONE CAN ONLY DREAM. HE THAT KILLS AN ANIMAL IS BRAVE

BUT HE THAT KILLS A GOD WILL BEGIN OUR APOTHEOSIS.

FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT INTO OUR PINNACLE, OUR PERFECT SYMPHONY

-AZRAEL"

I need help getting my website back. I need to know whoever hacked my domain and why they're doing this. If you can do anything to get this person out, that would be amazing.

-Thanks, Francis M. Kaufman
