Addressed to Detective Grelm,

It's become worse.

My entire computer has been taken over by strange messages encoded. I attempted to cancel the payments, but upon pressing the button nothing happened. Again and again I'd click and nothing would happen. After the last letter I saw a txt file installed onto my personal computer, entitled Francis.txt. I understand you're on vacation, when I came to your house yesterday your sister Chloe stopped me at the door.

I beg you, please help me. It's taking over my life.
